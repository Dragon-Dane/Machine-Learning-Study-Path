requires a significant amount of computational resources, which in turn consumes significants amount of energy, which would emit a significant amount of carbon when generated. Newer models and methods, which rely on re-training to optimise architectures and hyper-parameters, significantly increase the cost of training.</p> <p>Research finds that while a car consumes 126,000 pounds of CO2 in its lifetime, training a single, large NLP model with an optimal neural architecture search on a GPU requires about 626,000 pounds of CO2 - over 5 times that of a car. This is largely due to the energy required to power the model, which often takes weeks or even months. Though climate research suggests that humanity must cut carbon emissions by half over the next decade, this may become increasingly difficult should training neural networks become the norm.</p> <p>The paper assigns a dollar cost to training a variety of state-of-the-art NLP models, which is calculated by finding the energy required to train each model, and then finding the associated electricity cost. The first finding is that TPUs are more cost-efficient than GPUs on mid-sized models. The next is that NLP models are extremely harmful to the environment - training a GPU on, say, a BERT model emits approximately the same amount of Carbon as a trans-American flight.</p> <p>The paper concludes by recommending that researchers consider energy emissions during their model creations, as well as encouraging a more equitable access to computational resources.</p> <ul><li><strong>May - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02175.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adversarial features are not bugs, they are features<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>This paper attacks one of the most prominent criticisms of neural networks - the fact that adversarial examples are flaws in the performance of such networks.</p> <p>Adversarial examples are imperceptibly altered natural inputs that induce incorrect predictions by image classifiers. The reason as to why such examples exist has been researched in great depth, though no theories have so far been able to truly capture the phenomena seen in practise.</p> <p>The paper demonstrates that adversarial examples are the direct product of the identification by classifiers of non-robust features - features derived from patterns in the data that are highly predictive, yet brittle and incomprehensible to humans. An example would be an image of a panda - while a human would typically associate a panda with its short tail or its well-rounded ears, an image classifier may identify a non-robust feature which it believes to be highly predictive, say the shape of its thumb.</p> <p>The paper postulates that classification models learn to rely on such non-robust features to make their predictions, which lead to adversarial examples that are able to exploit this dependence. This is because we usually train classifiers to solely maximize accuracy - thus, classifiers tend to use any available signal to do so, even those that look incomprehensible to humans. After all, the presence of a tail or ears is no more natural to a classifier than any other equally predictive pattern.</p> <p>The hypothesis also provides a solution to the problem of adversarial transferability, or the idea that the adversarial examples that can be applied to one model can usually also be applied on another. This is because models tend to learn common features- if a non-robust feature is one that helps identify an image, it would be learnt by any model.</p> <p>Lastly, the paper suggests that methods aiming to enhance the interpretability of a given model by attempting to reduce such non-robust features actually reduce the interpretability of a model. As such, producing human-meaningful explanations must be pursued independently from the training of highly-accurate models.<br></p> <ul><li><strong>May - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08233v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Few-Shot Adversarial Learning of Realistic Neural Talking Head Models<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>This paper describes a few-shot (utilises a small handful of input images) and one-shot (utilises just one input image) technique to make humans in portrait images appear to be talking. It outperforms all other existing models in this manner, as it can make realistic videos of portraits such as that of Mona Lisa and Marilyn Monroe.</p> <p>This paper employs an architecture that is composed of three distinct neural networks which work in tandem. The first is an ‘Embedder’, which takes coloured images and identifies that landmark items within such images, such as eyes and ears. It then compresses the information regarding the position of such items, and feeds this into the ‘Generator’ network. This network takes in information regarding the position of landmark items, and then generates an image that corresponds to such landmarks. The ‘Discriminator’, the final network, then compares the base input image to the generated image, and outputs a ‘Realism score’ which indicates how similar the synthesised image is to its base image. This score is used to improve the performance of both the Embedder and Generator.</p> <p>The authors of the paper believe that the paper can help make VR and AR communication more realistic and compelling, as the avatars created can be of a far better overall quality. They also recognise, however, that such a technology can be used to create ‘deep fake’ videos, which are artificially generated videos of individuals doing or saying something that they didn’t actually do or say.<br></p> <ul><li><strong>April - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08379.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vid2Game: Controllable Characters Extracted from Real-World Videos<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>Pose estimation is a technique that takes a video featuring humans as input, and creates a mapping of the current position of the human which is bounded to their body.</p> <p>This paper describes an algorithm which utilises pose estimation, but allows for the poses created to be controllable - for example, if the ‘right’ key is pressed on the keyboard after a human pose has been identified, that human simulation will move rightwards in a human-like manner.</p> <p>This allows for implementation in video games - an input video of a human can be obtained, then it can be fed into the algorithm, after which it can be controlled by a human gamer in order to achieve a particular goal.</p> <p>Its Pose2Frame capabilities makes it able to blend poses of humans into varying backgrounds.

The system is intended to improve the ability of those with impaired voices to speak in an audible, human-like manner. It is the newest revelation in brain-machine interface technology, a rising field.</p> <p>Decoding speech from neural activity is a particularly difficult problem because the act of speaking requires very precise and rapid control of our vocal tract articulators. The system uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to translate cortical activity (i.e. brain signals) into representations of commands for the movement of these vocal articulators. These brain signals are detected via the placement of a stamp-sized pad, with hundreds of tiny electrodes, at the surface of a human brain. It then uses RNNs once again to transform these commands into speech acoustics.</p> <p>In clinical tests, as much as 70 percent of what was spoken by the virtual system was intelligible. The RNN is able to perform relatively well because articulatory representations were found to be highly similar across speakers, enabling a component of the decoder to be transferrable.</p> <p>With continued progress in this domain, scientists can hope that individuals with speech impairments will regain the ability to freely speak their minds and reconnect with the world around them.</p> <ul><li><strong>March - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07291.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Image Normalisation with SPACE<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>This paper describes a network that is able to generate high resolution images from simple drawings.

Pruning techniques in the past have been largely unsuccessful - even papers by pioneers like Yann LeCun and Geoffery Hinton have been unable to come close to matching the performance of the entire network with a pruned network.</p> <p>The lottery-ticket hypothesis, which was the winning paper of ICLR 2019, suggests that a randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that - when trained in isolation - it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations. It relies on a standard pruning technique which automatically identifies such trainable subnetworks (known as the ‘winning tickets’) by eliminating parameters (and thus network connections) which contribute least to the overall output of the network. It takes the following steps:</p> <ol><li>Randomly initialize a neural network.</li> <li>Train the network for j iterations, arriving at a certain distribution of parameters.</li> <li>Prune the p% of parameters with the lowest absolute value in this network.</li> <li>Reinitialise the remaining parameters to their values in the original, randomly-initialized network, leaving you with the ‘winning ticket’ network.</li></ol> <p>Once this pruned network has created, the paper shows that the performance of the smaller network is on par with that of the entire network. Aggressively pruned networks, where 95 to 99 percent of parameters are pruned, showed no dip in performance in comparison to the original network. However, moderately pruned networks, where 50 to 90 percent of parameters are pruned, were able to even exceed performance of their unpruned counterparts.</p> <p>The pruning technique described above is one-shot, as the unpruned network is trained just once. The paper, however, indicates that a more effective variation of this is to utilise iterative pruning - this relies on pruning the network over n rounds, and at each round pruning p/n% of the parameters.</p> <p>The hypothesis provided by the paper is intended to not only significantly reduce the number of parameters that a network must train, thus greatly reducing training time as well, but also allowing us to design better overall networks with less unnecessary noise. <br></p> <ul><li><strong>March - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08931-6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humans can decipher adversarial images<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>Though recent Convolutional Neural Network systems have surpassed human performance in image detection problems, a problem does remain - simply modifying a pixel or two in the image can cause the system to classify the image as something vastly different. For example, reconfiguring a pixel or two is all it takes for a computer to classify an apple as a car. This ability to ‘fool’ image recognition systems has been criticised as an indication that such systems are unable to interpret images in the same manner as a human would, though a recent paper suggests that this may not be the case.</p> <p>In the paper, a pair of cognitive psychologists showed a group of over 1800 subjects images that had already tricked computers into classifying it under the wrong label. They asked people which of two options the computer predicted the object as being - one option being the computer's real conclusion and the other being a random answer. The subjects chose the same answer as computers 75% of the time, and a remarkable 98% of them tended to answer like the computers did.</p> <p>Next, the researchers gave subjects a choice between the system’s answer and its next-best guess for images it guessed incorrectly. Once again, the subjects again validated the computer's choices - 91 percent of those tested agreed with the system’s decision.</p> <p>The study thus provides a degree of evidence that the apparent flaw with Convolutional Neural Network architectures may not be as bad as many think.

It provides the ability to generate images of a scene, identify the GAN units or neurons that contribute to a particular object that is part of a scene, and then harness these to either activate or deactivate the presence of that particular object. This thus enables us to manipulate images without the need for tools like Photoshop.</p> <p>For example, if we had an image of a church, we could indicate to this framework that we wished to remove the doors present in the image. The framework would thus remove the doors while maintaining the structure of the rest of the image in a suitable manner. We could then add the doors back, if desired. On top of this, we can select a particular region of an image where we wish to add something new - for example, I could add a tree to the right side of the image of a church. The framework understands that the trees have a root in the ground, and thus builds on from the ground up in the specified location. The framework is further able to recognise where additions are not suitable - for example, if we wished to draw a door in the sky, the framework would not accept this request.</p> <p>The framework uses a segmentation network along with a dissection method to identify the individual units of the generator that match meaningful object classes, like trees. It then activates and deactivates the neurons corresponding to each object class when they are modified in the image - for example, inserting a tree activates the neurons in the GAN that corresponds to a tree. What allows this is a key finding in the paper - the same neurons control a specific object class in a variety of contexts, even if the final appearance of the object varies tremendously.

It has the potential to be applied to other fields, and has thus far been tested successfully on cars and rooms.</p> <p>The generator can combine different aspects of images. For example, if one wished to overlay the gender of one face with the face of another, the generator can do so. The aspects that can be transferred include gender, hair length, pose and the presence of glasses.</p> <p>The parameters of the generator can also be controlled one by one without modifying the core content of an image. For example, the presence of a stubble can be modified.</p> <p>The generator can also perform interpolation. This means that if we have two images A and B, the generator can create intermediate images that map one to another. It can even change the gender in the process. All intermediate images look real too.<br></p> <ul><li><strong>July - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01697.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Corruption &amp; Perturbations<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>This paper underlines a method to evaluate the performance of Image Classifiers in terms of their ability to withstand corruptions and perturbations.

When training a Machine Learning model, it is thus crucial that the test data is not involved in the process of creating the model, as this would introduce bias towards the test set. Unfortunately, we typically have limited access to new data from the same distribution, which results in many researchers today using the test set in place of a validation set. This allows for hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, to be optimised in accordance to the distribution of the selected test set.</p> <p>The research paper proposes a new test set with about 2000 instances which matches the distribution of the test set for the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known dataset that many modern image classifier models are tested on. It then evaluates the performance of 30 different modern image classification models. It finds that there is a significant drop from the accuracy in the original test set to the new test set - for instance, VGG and ResNet architectures drop from their well-established 93% accuracy to about 85%. However, the performance of classifiers relative to one another remains more or less constant - thus, the distribution in performance of classifiers can be considered to simply be horizontally shifted.</p> <p>The results cast doubt on the robustness of current classifiers. The classification accuracy of widely used models drops significantly - for example, the accuracy loss of VGG and ResNet corresponds to multiple years of progress on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The distribution shift thus questions to what extent current models truly generalise.<br></p> <ul><li><strong>June - <a href="http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RF-Pose<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong></li></ul> <p>The paper provides accurate human pose estimation through walls and occlusions.

Firstly, say medical patients are unwilling to have their health records be sent to other hospitals and organisations who they cannot trust. Federated Learning suggests that each hospital construct its own model using the limited patient data that it has, and then it assembles the models of each hospital into a single, unified model using Google's Federated Averaging algorithm. Secondly, say that we wish to train a predictive keyboard to be uniquely suited to our personal typing patterns on our smartphone. We can use a Federated model, which has been trained and compiled from the predictive patterns of many different users and their data, and then pass in our own personal keyboard typing data to update the model to be better suited to our personal typing habits.</p> <p>Federated Learning technqiues have seen many updates and improvements since, and will certainly remain relevant as AI enters a privacy-centered time in its development.<br><br></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
